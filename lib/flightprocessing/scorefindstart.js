/*
 * Start sectors are the same for all types of tasks
 *
 * Although not all competitions use start sectors at present Onglide only supports sectors and when the task
 * is loaded from SoaringSpot it will convert a line into a sector. This isn't a perfect optimization but simplifies
 * in or out of sector calculation. Turf appears to do intersect so may be easier to fix this than it was using
 * goole maps
